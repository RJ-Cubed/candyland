We bought a dozen, and, three days later, they were all gone. Man - that was good eating. Loved them.',

A man in AZ who eats chocolate daily is 115; a Mexican woman is 125 and the French woman who famously lived to 122 was a daily eater of chocoalte. The key is to have low sugar, and a high percentage of cacao---70% or higher. I have found that anything higher than 85% (like this one) is too bitter. Just a tiny bit of sugar goes a long way with cacao. The reason is especially like this brand is that the Europeans tend to have less mold in the way they process chocolate.',

The only problem that knocks it down a star, is the sourcing of the cocoa is unknown. It would be nice to know if it follows fair trade practices.',

Not only was it surprisingly difficult to find plain milk chocolate berries, these were superbly packaged. They come with a freezer pack wrapped in plastic, and they have a foam portion in the box to make sure the berries stay in place. The most important part though is these are not small berries. The chocolate is really thick, and these are well worth the price. Plus, if you have Prime, you cant beat the shipping option! Ill definitely purchase again.',
